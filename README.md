# gamerGorlBot

Gamer Gorl Bot is a Discord bot I built for my friends to let them compare each other's Steam wishlists.

I stood the thing up with solid help from:
- the Discord Developer [Getting Started](https://discord.com/developers/docs/quick-start/getting-started) guide
- the [Steam Wish list Calculator](https://www.steamwishlistcalculator.com/)
- Fly.io and their docs, where I deployed this bot (can't recommend Fly enough, especially for projects this small)

Currently, the Bot allows users to execute the following slash commands in a user or server context in Discord:
- `/compare`: returns shared games on selected users' wishlists
- `/on-sale`: returns any on sale games from all users' wishlists
- `/wishlist`: returns names and prices of all games on all users' wishlists
